# Pet Information Web Application
Creating a small demo app that works with "Pet" data, i.e., dogs, cats & birds.
This app will show all of the pets from a "petData" array of objects and allow the user to filter which pets they would like to see.
This app must also be visually appealing, so we must update/override existing CSS to create a more customized experience for the user

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
